We want to use a organized color scheme for our console. 

Foreground colors:
Yellow - and attempt is being made - initial intent

Background Colors:
Green - Intent completed succesffully - intent PASS
Red - Intent was unsuccessful. - intent FAIL
Yellow - Intent was unsuccessful, but non-breaking / error inducing.
